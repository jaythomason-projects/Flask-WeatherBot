## Meet Flask-WeatherBot - A Fairly Useless And Very Specific Robotic-Sounding Weather Thing

This is WeatherBot. Ask it the weather, and it will tell you the weather. You can also ask it questions about travelling in the UK, if youâ€™d like. Sometimes it will answer, other times, it will spout nonsense.

This app is built using Flask for the front-end and Python and Chatterbot for the back-end. It is capable of handling various location-based weather queries. Additionally, it uses a database to store weather and location data, reducing the need for excessive API calls.

## Instructions
### Installation
1. You'll need to install Python 3.7. You can download the different versions of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment by running `source ./venv/bin/activate`
4. To install the prerequisites, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. The app uses two APIs: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Google Geocode](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview). You'll need to sign up for both and get your own API keys. Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys like this:

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

6. To run the app, navigate to the folder and run `flask run` in your terminal.
7. Go to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

### Tips
- Weatherbot only reads your most recent statement ðŸ˜¢ You won't be able to ask follow-up questions about previous statements or make corrections. If your question was misinterpreted, try re-typing the full question.
