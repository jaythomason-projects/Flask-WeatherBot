## Weatherbot - A Weather Chatbot built with Flask and Chatterbot

This is Weatherbot, a Flask-based weather chatbot that gives accurate, real-time weather info for any location, with a special focus on the UK. Weatherbot also has some handy tips for anyone exploring the UK.

This app is built with a Flask front-end and Python back-end, allowing it to handle various location-based weather queries. Plus, it uses database caching to store weather and location data, so you wonâ€™t have to make too many API calls.
